# Hachi
Dog's breed Classifier and Similar Dogs search engine. An Flask app to classify Dog's type and Find similar dogs.
Instructions
Run Classification:
## Train Model - Classification/Dogs.ipynb 
Then save the model- Gogs.h5

Run Server:
python3 server.py

## Abstract
This codebase tries to present in the simplest and most compact way a few of the major Transfer Learning techniques, which have emerged over the past years. This code contains two main things :- Classification with the help of Transfer Learning and Features extraction for Image similarity. Flask is used for serving these models.

[Classification](#Classification)

[Image-similarity](#Image-similarity)

[Weights](#Weights)
